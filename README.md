# Course Enrollments at Harvard College

## Introduction

This project explores the course enrollments at Harvard College. More specifically, it compares the course enrollment data in 2018 Spring and 2019 Spring (the semester this project is made!). Using R, this project created two tables that show (1) the 10 largest course enrollment decreases, and (2) the largest course newly offered in 2019 Spring.

`enrollment.Rmd` is the Rmarkdown files used to explore the data. For the result of this project, see this [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/ruoqi_zhang/gov-1005-2019-02-26) page.

## Data
