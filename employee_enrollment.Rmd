# Filters Courses That Have Employees
# 
# A function to process dataframes from different semesters. It cleans variable
# names, and filters out the courses that have employee enrollments. It also
# filters out rows that are not courses.
# 
# @param enrollment_df A dplyr tibble
# @return A cleaned dplyr tibble with courses that have employee enrollment.

    # that is, that have non-zero employee value.

# Fetches Enrollment Data and Transform Into Tibble
#
# This function takes in two strings and creates tibble objects accordingly. It
# is intended to take in Harvard Registrar's enrollment records and turn them
# into corresponding tibbles.
#
# @param table_url A string. The url of enrollment files provided by Harvard
#   Registrar.
# @param term A string. Used to describe the semester of the enrollment file.
#   Will also name the object created for the tibble.
# @return A tibble named by parameter term, containing data from table_url.

  # We don't want all the downloaded files to be piled in the working directory.
  # Therefore, we create a directory to store the downloaded excel files. We
  # first examine whether the directory already exists. If not, we create a
  # directory called enrollment_data/ under the working directory.

  # We treat them differently (skip different number of lines) by using
  # conditional statement.
  #
  # For each semester, we want an individual tibble to store its data.
  # Therefore, to dynamically name variables, we use the assign() function to
  # assign the data to the name specified by parameter 'term'. To make the
  # objects accessible outside the function body, we specify parameter envir as
